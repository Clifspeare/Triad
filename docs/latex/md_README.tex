Robust and pleasant cross-\/platform note taking application.

Triad is split into two parts, a frontend UI written in Q\+M\+L/\+Javascript, and a backend for data management written in Qt/\+C++.

Roadmap\+: First goal is a fully functional rich text editor that allows \char`\"{}content\char`\"{} containers to be placed all over the application. This will save in directories with raw html files.

Next step is compliance with the M\+S-\/\+O\+NE specification. This will allow Triad to interoperate with \href{outline.ws}{\tt Outline} and \href{onenote.com}{\tt Onenote}. Nothing like this exists on Linux, and considerations for that platform will drive development. As a secondary consideration, Triad should also function on Windows and Mac\+O\+SX.

Triad should be able to sync with Web\+Dav instances, other cloud storage providers like Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. Syncing with One\+Drive and i\+Cloud should also be considered.

A functioning Android build is a priority.
